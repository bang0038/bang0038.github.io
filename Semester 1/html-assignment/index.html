            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a <em>Wedding Photographer</em> here in Ottawa and a student in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College. So far, I am really enjoying this program and am learning tons of new things. I joined this program because I wanted to strengthen my skills in technology and design and also apply what I learn to my own business.
            </p>
        
            <p>I am a mom to a 1 year old baby girl. Between school, running my own business & being a mom life is very busy. In my free time I enjoy going to the gym, taking photos, hanging out with my friends, watching Netflix and playing video games, yes, I'm a cool mom. This is my 2<sup>nd</sup> time at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> and I am super excited to see where this program takes me.
