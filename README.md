WEB-PORTFOLIO REFLECTION

I absolutely enjoyed building this website. To my surprise, it was the most fun I've had building a website to date. I'm extremely proud of how far I've come as a designer
and I truly feel that this is reflected in this piece of work. Firstly, I'd like to thank you Rob for being such an awesome teacher! You helped me understand code like I never have
before and I am so excited to take on a career in this field one day!

Now, let's get started wit the reflection.

There were three main parts to this project for me: 

1. The Mock-Up
2. The HTML/Bootstrap/CSS
3. Polishing and having fun

1. The Mock-Up

Building this mock-up was extremely fun, mainly because as I built it, I knew that I knew how to do and incorporate everything that I was designing in XD. In the beginning of the 
year, I would make mock-ups and think "how on earth am I going to code this?" But now at the end of the year, I can confidently create a mockup within XD and now that I can re-create
it without any issues in visual studio code. The mock-up process started by drawing a rough sketch on my iPad, and then sourcing images that I wanted to use. From there, I extracted
the colours that I wanted to use and made a mood board with colours, fonts etc. Then, I started designing in XD, created my layout and important my colours, fonts, images, etc. I 
also wrote up a document that was filled with the content I wanted on the page.

2. The HTML/Bootstrap/CSS

This was the fun part for me and surprisingly the quickest. The HTML took me no time, I can thank Bootstrap for that! It really was as simple as writing my code, implementing
what I wanted from Bootstrap, tweaking/customizing it and polishing it within CSS! I had such a great time doing this. I really did not face any challenges while writing the code
that couldn't be solved with a simple google search. I did encounter one issue where my images would resize/stretch oddly when I opened the page on my cellphone, I fixed this by
making sure the images were within the container!

3. Polishing and having fun

This again was the fun part, I played around with sizing, adding extra content, animations/transformations, hover effects, etc! This is when I started to see the final product come together and started to make my final pushes to Github. After reading over the project guidelines again, I realized that I had to submit my username.gitgub.io link without
a file path! So I changed it, as my link was originally username.githun.io/web-portfolio (phew)! Happy that I caught that.

All in all, I encountered minor problems when building this portfolio and it truly was a pleasure to build! I used all the skills that I have learned to date to build it and 
using bootstrap helped make bringing the vision I had in my head, then in XD that much easier!
